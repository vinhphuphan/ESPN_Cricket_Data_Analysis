# 🏏 ESPN Cricket Data Analysis - Power BI Project
### 📌 Overview

This is a Power BI practice project that analyzes international **batting, bowling, and fielding statistics** of the **Australia cricket team** when playing at home venues. The dataset is sourced from [ESPNcricinfo Statsguru](https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html), one of the most reputable cricket statistics platforms.

Through this project, I aim to explore and visualize key performance metrics of Australian batsmen to enhance my Power BI skills and data storytelling capabilities.

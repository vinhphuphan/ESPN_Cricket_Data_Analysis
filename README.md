# 🏏 ESPN Cricket Data Analysis - Power BI Project

### 📌 Overview

This is a Power BI practice project that analyzes international **batting and bowling statistics** of the **Australia cricket team** when playing at home venues. The dataset is sourced from [ESPNcricinfo Statsguru](https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html), one of the most reputable cricket statistics platforms.

Through this project, I aim to explore and visualize key performance metrics of Australian batsmen to enhance my Power BI skills and data storytelling capabilities.

### 🧾 Data Source

* **Website**: [ESPNcricinfo Statsguru](https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;home_or_away=1;team=2;template=results;type=batting)
* **Context**: The dataset includes **batting and bowling records** of Australian players in **ODI matches** played on **home grounds**.
* **Note**: For training purposes, only the **first page (50 records)** was scraped and used in this analysis.
